            <p>
              Every pipeline company in Canada must meet federal, provincial or
              territorial, and local requirements. This includes Acts,
              Regulations, rules, bylaws, and zoning restrictions. Pipelines are
              also bound by technical, safety, and environmental standards along
              with company rules, protocols and management systems. In addition
              to these requirements, the CER may add conditions to regulatory
              instruments that each company must meet. Condition compliance is
              monitored by the CER and
              <a href="/en/safety-environment/compliance-enforcement/index.html"
                >enforcement</a
              >
              action is taken when required. Conditions are often relevant to a
              specific region. The map below displays the number of in progress
              and closed conditions mapped to economic regions as defined by
              <a

              <p>
                Companies self-report incidents and are expected to take a
                precautionary approach in doing so. This means that even when
                there is doubt as to whether an incident should be reported, the
                company must report it. The approach is, “When in doubt,
                report.” This is consistent with CER-regulated companies’
                responsibility for anticipating, preventing, mitigating and
                managing incidents of any size or duration.

                    The CER reviews all reported incidents to assess whether
                    companies have taken the appropriate corrective actions and
                    to identify potential trends in incidents. Each incident is
                    given a status indicating the current stage of the CER's
                    incident investigation.
